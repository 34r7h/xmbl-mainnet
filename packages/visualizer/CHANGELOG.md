## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- **SECURITY — the AIR zero-knowledge path leaked the entire secret trace.** Reported against
  0.1.12 and reproduced: the batching challenges `alpha` and `beta` are public and the composition
  `C(x) = alpha*u + beta*v` is an `F_p^4` element over two base-field unknowns, so every FRI opening
  was four equations in two unknowns. Solving two limbs for `v` gives `col'(x)` directly, and the
  `2*nq` layer-0 openings interpolate the blinded trace column — row 0 IS the witness. It returned
  the secret exactly, in about a second. The `(x^T - 1)` blind could not help: it is sized for the
  `2*nc` direct openings and vanishes on the trace domain by construction.

  The composition is now MASKED before FRI sees it: a uniformly random extension-valued polynomial
  `M` of degree `< K` is committed first, `gamma` is drawn from a transcript that includes its root,
  and FRI runs on `C + gamma*M`. Each opening is four equations in six unknowns. The verifier opens
  `M` against its own root at the consistency points. A mask that is not of degree `< K` would pin
  `gamma` to one value out of ~2^124, so masking cannot hide a false statement.

  `setup` now doubles `K` until it exceeds everything the transcript reveals
  (`nq*(log2 K + 1) + nc`, plus margin): `K = 2048`, `N = 16384`. `nc` is raised 16 -> 40, because
  each consistency point is `-log2(K/N) = 3` bits and `nc = 16` was a ~48-bit check behind a
  ~100-bit FRI. Coset evaluation is now an NTT, so proving is faster than 0.1.12 despite the larger
  domain. **PROOFS FROM 0.1.12 DO NOT VERIFY ON 0.1.13** — the proof carries new commitments
  (`rootM`, `rootD`) and the derived parameters moved.

  `xzk` (the cube-curve statement) was attacked the same way and survives: the committed curve is
  fully recoverable from its FRI openings, but `Pt = P + Z_R*B` with `B` uniform of degree 18 over a
  witness quotient of degree 1, so the same proof is carried by a 2-parameter family of witnesses.

  The attack is now a permanent check in `air.test.mjs` and `xzk.test.mjs`.
